This is roughly equivalent to calling <code>.css( \"display\", \"none\" )</code>, except that the value of the <code>display</code> property is saved in jQuery's data cache so that <code>display</code> can later be restored to its initial value. If an element has a <code>display</code> value of <code>inline</code> and is hidden then shown, it will once again be displayed <code>inline</code>.</p>\n    <p>When a duration, a plain object, or a \"complete\" function is provided, <code>.hide()</code> becomes an animation method. The <code>.hide()</code> method animates the width, height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously. When these properties reach 0, the <code>display</code> style property is set to <code>none</code> to ensure that the element no longer affects the layout of the page.</p>\n    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively.</p>\n    <p>Note that <code>.hide()</code> is fired immediately and will override the animation queue if no duration or a duration of 0 is specified.</p>\n    <p>As of jQuery <strong>1.4.3</strong>, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com\">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>\n    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>\n    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n&lt;div id=\"clickme\"&gt;\n  Click here\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;img id=\"book\" src=\"book.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"123\"&gt;\n    </code></pre>\n    <pre><code>\n// With the element initially shown, we can hide it slowly:\n$( \"#clickme\" ).click(function() {\n  $( \"#book\" ).hide( \"slow\", function() {\n    alert( \"Animation complete.\" );\n  });\n});\n    </code></pre>\n    <p class=\"image four-across\">\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_06_05.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_06_06.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_06_07.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_06_08.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n  "}]}
