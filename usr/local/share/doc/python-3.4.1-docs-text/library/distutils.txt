"distutils" --- Building and installing Python modules
******************************************************

The "distutils" package provides support for building and installing
additional modules into a Python installation.  The new modules may be
either 100%-pure Python, or may be extension modules written in C, or
may be collections of Python packages which include modules coded in
both Python and C.

Most Python users will *not* want to use this module directly, but
instead use the cross-version tools maintained by the Python Packaging
Authority. Refer to the Python Packaging User Guide for more
information.

For the benefits of packaging tool authors and users seeking a deeper
understanding of the details of the current packaging and distribution
system, the legacy "distutils" based user documentation and API
reference remain available:

* *Installing Python Modules (Legacy version)*

* *Distributing Python Modules (Legacy version)*
