"asyncio" -- Asynchronous I/O, event loop, coroutines and tasks
***************************************************************

New in version 3.4.

**Source code:** Lib/asyncio/

======================================================================

This module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded
concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets
and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other
related primitives. Here is a more detailed list of the package
contents:

* a pluggable *event loop* with various system-specific
  implementations;

* *transport* and *protocol* abstractions (similar to those in
  Twisted);

* concrete support for TCP, UDP, SSL, subprocess pipes, delayed
  calls, and others (some may be system-dependent);

* a "Future" class that mimics the one in the "concurrent.futures"
  module, but adapted for use with the event loop;

* coroutines and tasks based on "yield from" (**PEP 380**), to help
  write concurrent code in a sequential fashion;

* cancellation support for "Future"s and coroutines;

* *synchronization primitives* for use between coroutines in a
  single thread, mimicking those in the "threading" module;

* an interface for passing work off to a threadpool, for times when
  you absolutely, positively have to use a library that makes blocking
  I/O calls.
