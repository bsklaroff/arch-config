"spwd" --- The shadow password database
***************************************

This module provides access to the Unix shadow password database. It
is available on various Unix versions.

You must have enough privileges to access the shadow password database
(this usually means you have to be root).

Shadow password database entries are reported as a tuple-like object,
whose attributes correspond to the members of the "spwd" structure
(Attribute field below, see "<shadow.h>"):

+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| Index   | Attribute       | Meaning                           |
+=========+=================+===================================+
| 0       | "sp_namp"       | Login name                        |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1       | "sp_pwdp"       | Encrypted password                |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2       | "sp_lstchg"     | Date of last change               |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3       | "sp_min"        | Minimal number of days between    |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4       | "sp_max"        | Maximum number of days between    |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5       | "sp_warn"       | Number of days before password    |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 6       | "sp_inact"      | Number of days after password     |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 7       | "sp_expire"     | Number of days since 1970-01-01   |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 8       | "sp_flag"       | Reserved                          |
+---------+-----------------+-----------------------------------+

The sp_namp and sp_pwdp items are strings, all others are integers.
"KeyError" is raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.

The following functions are defined:

spwd.getspnam(name)

   Return the shadow password database entry for the given user name.

spwd.getspall()

   Return a list of all available shadow password database entries, in
   arbitrary order.
