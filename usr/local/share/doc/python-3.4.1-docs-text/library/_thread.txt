"_thread" --- Low-level threading API
*************************************

This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple
threads (also called *light-weight processes* or *tasks*) --- multiple
threads of control sharing their global data space.  For
synchronization, simple locks (also called *mutexes* or *binary
semaphores*) are provided. The "threading" module provides an easier
to use and higher-level threading API built on top of this module.

The module is optional.  It is supported on Windows, Linux, SGI IRIX,
Solaris 2.x, as well as on systems that have a POSIX thread (a.k.a.
"pthread") implementation.  For systems lacking the "_thread" module,
the "_dummy_thread" module is available. It duplicates this module's
interface and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

It defines the following constants and functions:

exception exception _thread.error

   Raised on thread-specific errors.

   Changed in version 3.3: This is now a synonym of the built-in
   "RuntimeError".

_thread.LockType

   This is the type of lock objects.

_thread.start_new_thread(function, args[, kwargs])

   Start a new thread and return its identifier.  The thread executes
   the function *function* with the argument list *args* (which must
   be a tuple).  The optional *kwargs* argument specifies a dictionary
   of keyword arguments. When the function returns, the thread
   silently exits.  When the function terminates with an unhandled
   exception, a stack trace is printed and then the thread exits (but
   other threads continue to run).

_thread.interrupt_main()

   Raise a "KeyboardInterrupt" exception in the main thread.  A
   subthread can use this function to interrupt the main thread.

_thread.exit()

   Raise the "SystemExit" exception.  When not caught, this will cause
   the thread to exit silently.

_thread.allocate_lock()

   Return a new lock object.  Methods of locks are described below.
   The lock is initially unlocked.

_thread.get_ident()

   Return the 'thread identifier' of the current thread.  This is a
   nonzero integer.  Its value has no direct meaning; it is intended
   as a magic cookie to be used e.g. to index a dictionary of thread-
   specific data.  Thread identifiers may be recycled when a thread
   exits and another thread is created.

_thread.stack_size([size])

   Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The
   optional *size* argument specifies the stack size to be used for
   subsequently created threads, and must be 0 (use platform or
   configured default) or a positive integer value of at least 32,768
   (32 KiB). If changing the thread stack size is unsupported, a
   "RuntimeError" is raised.  If the specified stack size is invalid,
   a "ValueError" is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32 KiB
   is currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee
   sufficient stack space for the interpreter itself.  Note that some
   platforms may have particular restrictions on values for the stack
   size, such as requiring a minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring
   allocation in multiples of the system memory page size - platform
   documentation should be referred to for more information (4 KiB
   pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is the
   suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).
   Availability: Windows, systems with POSIX threads.

_thread.TIMEOUT_MAX

   The maximum value allowed for the *timeout* parameter of
   "Lock.acquire()". Specifying a timeout greater than this value will
   raise an "OverflowError".

   New in version 3.2.

Lock objects have the following methods:

lock.acquire(waitflag=1, timeout=-1)

   Without any optional argument, this method acquires the lock
   unconditionally, if necessary waiting until it is released by
   another thread (only one thread at a time can acquire a lock ---
   that's their reason for existence).

   If the integer *waitflag* argument is present, the action depends
   on its value: if it is zero, the lock is only acquired if it can be
   acquired immediately without waiting, while if it is nonzero, the
   lock is acquired unconditionally as above.

   If the floating-point *timeout* argument is present and positive,
   it specifies the maximum wait time in seconds before returning.  A
   negative *timeout* argument specifies an unbounded wait.  You
   cannot specify a *timeout* if *waitflag* is zero.

   The return value is "True" if the lock is acquired successfully,
   "False" if not.

   Changed in version 3.2: The *timeout* parameter is new.

   Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquires can now be interrupted by
   signals on POSIX.

lock.release()

   Releases the lock.  The lock must have been acquired earlier, but
   not necessarily by the same thread.

lock.locked()

   Return the status of the lock: "True" if it has been acquired by
   some thread, "False" if not.

In addition to these methods, lock objects can also be used via the
"with" statement, e.g.:

   import _thread

   a_lock = _thread.allocate_lock()

   with a_lock:
       print("a_lock is locked while this executes")

**Caveats:**

* Threads interact strangely with interrupts: the
  "KeyboardInterrupt" exception will be received by an arbitrary
  thread.  (When the "signal" module is available, interrupts always
  go to the main thread.)

* Calling "sys.exit()" or raising the "SystemExit" exception is
  equivalent to calling "_thread.exit()".

* Not all built-in functions that may block waiting for I/O allow
  other threads to run.  (The most popular ones ("time.sleep()",
  "io.FileIO.read()", "select.select()") work as expected.)

* It is not possible to interrupt the "acquire()" method on a lock
  --- the "KeyboardInterrupt" exception will happen after the lock has
  been acquired.

* When the main thread exits, it is system defined whether the other
  threads survive.  On most systems, they are killed without executing
  "try" ... "finally" clauses or executing object destructors.

* When the main thread exits, it does not do any of its usual
  cleanup (except that "try" ... "finally" clauses are honored), and
  the standard I/O files are not flushed.
