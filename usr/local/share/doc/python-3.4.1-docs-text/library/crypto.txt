Cryptographic Services
**********************

The modules described in this chapter implement various algorithms of
a cryptographic nature.  They are available at the discretion of the
installation. On Unix systems, the "crypt" module may also be
available. Here's an overview:

* "hashlib" --- Secure hashes and message digests

  * Hash algorithms

  * Key Derivation Function

* "hmac" --- Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication

Hardcore cypherpunks will probably find the cryptographic modules
written by A.M. Kuchling of further interest; the package contains
modules for various encryption algorithms, most notably AES.  These
modules are not distributed with Python but available separately.  See
the URL http://www.pycrypto.org  for more information.
