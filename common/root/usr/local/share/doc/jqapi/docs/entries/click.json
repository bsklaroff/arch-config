Any HTML element can receive this event.\n    For example, consider the HTML:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n&lt;div id=\"target\"&gt;\n  Click here\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"other\"&gt;\n  Trigger the handler\n&lt;/div&gt;\n    </code></pre>\n    <p class=\"image\">\n      <img src=\"/resources/0042_05_03.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#target\" ).click(function() {\n  alert( \"Handler for .click() called.\" );\n});\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>Now if we click on this element, the alert is displayed:</p>\n    <p>\n      <samp>Handler for .click() called.</samp>\n    </p>\n    <p>We can also trigger the event when a different element is clicked:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#other\" ).click(function() {\n  $( \"#target\" ).click();\n});\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>After this code executes, clicking on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>\n    <p>The <code>click</code> event is only triggered after this exact series of events:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The mouse button is depressed while the pointer is inside the element.</li>\n      <li>The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>This is usually the desired sequence before taking an action.
